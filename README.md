# My Reads
## Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program. Project #7

### About app

My Read app lets you to track status of your favourite books. You can mark them as a 'Currently Reading', 'Want to Read' and 'Read'. Also, you can search books by specific keywords and add them to your shelf!

### About project

This is a seventh Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Program project and my very first work with React. I used provided by Udacity API and React Router. I'm proud of myself, because that was a loooot of new things!

### Install

1. Download all files:
  * Use green 'clone or download' button.
    * Download ZIP file.
    * Clone repo using Git.
    
2. Navigate to the downloaded folder.

3. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`

4. Start the development server with `npm start`

### Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
